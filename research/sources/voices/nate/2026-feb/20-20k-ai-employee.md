# The $20K AI Employee and the Repricing of Software Work

The unit of work in software has shifted from instructions (human-written code) to tokens (purchased inference). This changes computing categorically, not incrementally. Developer roles are splitting into three tracks (orchestrators, systems builders, domain translators), enterprises are reorganizing around intelligence throughput instead of headcount, and the economics of building software have dropped enough that solopreneurs and vertical startups can compete on distribution and domain expertise rather than raw compute budgets.

## Key Learnings

**1. Tokens are the new unit of work, not an upgrade to existing tools.**
For sixty years the developer's job was translating business logic into machine instructions. Now you describe outcomes, feed context, and buy inference. The human role shifts from writing logic to specifying results and managing the intelligence budget.

**2. Per-token costs are falling 5-10x/year, but total spend is exploding (Jevons Paradox).**
GPT-4-level inference went from ~$20/M tokens to under $1. Meanwhile average enterprise AI spend hit $85K/month (+36% YoY), and the share planning >$100K/month doubled from 20% to 45%. Cheaper intelligence drives more consumption, not less.

**3. Token management is a new core organizational competency.**
Enterprises building internal routing platforms (cheap model for low-stakes, frontier model for hard tasks) are compounding advantages with every model release. Cursor's cost crisis after Anthropic repriced caching shows what happens when token economics aren't treated as a first-class business function.

**4. The developer role is splitting into three tracks.**
Orchestrators manage agents and specify outcomes (value scales with token budgets). Systems builders create the agent infrastructure, evaluation pipelines, and routing layers. Domain translators combine enough technical fluency with deep market knowledge to point intelligence at the right problems. The generic mid-level application developer is the most exposed.

**5. Enterprise org charts are repricing around intelligence throughput.**
Klarna cut from ~7K to ~3K employees while growing revenue; AI handles work of 853 FT customer service staff. AI-native companies run at 3-5x revenue-per-employee vs traditional SaaS. The backlog of projects that were never economically viable becomes a goldmine when build cost drops an order of magnitude.

**6. Vertical AI is eating markets that were "too small" for venture-backed software.**
Harvey ($300M for legal AI), EliseAI ($250M for real estate) — vertical AI replaces labor and services spend, not just software licenses, making TAMs multiples larger. Distribution and domain expertise beat raw compute budgets.

**7. The solopreneur minimum viable team is approaching one.**
Near-zero marginal cost, token spend that scales with revenue, no payroll. Domain expertise + AI fluency makes going independent a rational economic choice rather than a lifestyle trade-off.

## Actionable Takeaways

- Assess which of the three developer tracks (orchestrator, systems builder, domain translator) best matches your strengths and start a 90-day transition plan.
- Audit your org's token spend: are you routing tasks to the right model at the right cost, or burning budget on frontier models for low-stakes work?
- Treat AI API dependency as supply-chain risk — one pricing change from a provider can break your cost structure (see Cursor/Anthropic).
- Revisit the project backlog for work that was never viable at old build costs; the ROI math has changed by an order of magnitude.
- If you have deep domain expertise, evaluate the solopreneur/vertical AI path — the downside risk is lower and the addressable market is expanding.

## Further Investigation

- What does "token management as a core competency" look like operationally? What tooling, roles, and metrics are the leading enterprises actually using?
- How defensible is the domain translator track long-term as AI fluency becomes table stakes?
- Klarna's 7K→3K case is cited often — what broke in the process, and what's the employee/quality impact that isn't in the headline numbers?
- How do multi-provider strategies (Anthropic + OpenAI + Google) affect token economics and vendor lock-in risk?
- What's the actual failure rate for solopreneur AI businesses vs the survivorship bias in the narrative?
