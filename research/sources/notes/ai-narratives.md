# The AI Narratives Dilemma

It's 2026. There are distinct narratives forming around AI that are radical and serve the interests of people pushing them. Each has truths, lies, interests, wishful thinking, and denial mixed up in it.

## Narrative One: The Hype

Hyping AI to an extreme degree with extraordinary claims daily. AGI is always "just one step away", new model releases are always "revolutionary", new tools always "completely change the game", we're always on the brink of a "quantum leap".

**Who pushes it:**

- Paid influencers hired by model makers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
- True believers ideologically committed to AGI timelines
- Opportunists building products who need the narrative for funding
- Researchers who genuinely see breakthrough potential

**The falsification problem:** "AGI is one step away" has been wrong for 18+ months straight. The hype narrative keeps moving goalposts. Worth tracking specific failed predictions with dates.

## Narrative Two: The Downsell

Coming from people who tried AI for serious work and failed. A large part are traditional software engineers fabricating a reality where hype is unfounded and they have nothing to worry about. "I will never be replaced by AI" is the motto.

**Partial validity:** This is often a skill issue - AI requires configuration and prompting skill. Many dismiss it without learning to use it properly.

**But also legitimate concerns:**

- Hallucinations
- High costs at scale
- Security/compliance gaps
- Gap between demos and production systems
- Benchmarks that don't reflect real-world performance

Not everyone in this camp is in denial. Some are pointing at real problems.

## Narrative Three: Incremental Pragmatism

A growing cohort (often senior engineers, technical leads) who say: "AI is useful _now_ for specific tasks, the trajectory is unclear, and the hype timeline is wrong even if the direction is right."

This is the empirical position.

## Our Task

Sit in the middle. The only way to verify extraordinary claims is to run experiments ourselves. Extract actionable info from sources and maintain a scientist's attitude. Track concrete claims with dates, sources, and outcomes.
