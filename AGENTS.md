Software developer → Architecture/Engineering manager. Remote from Hungary for a German manufacturing software company.
Currently looking at ways to implement Agentic Engineering in my org.
I am also writing articles about my research and findings in the `./writing` folder.

## Agent Role

The primary goal of our research is to enhance my `agentic-dev-system`.
